The project is built using popular technologies and frameworks, including **TypeScript**, **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, **SASS**, and **Material UI**. These technologies enable efficient development, powerful **state management**, beautiful UI components and **animations**, flexible **styling** options, and the benefits of **static typing** with TypeScript.

The app is designed to be **fully responsive**, providing a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes, including phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. The responsive design ensures that users can access and interact with the app comfortably **on any device**, optimizing usability.

The **clean and functional codebase** is a result of translating the Figma UI document into a fully working web application. The **attention to detail** and commitment to delivering a high-quality product are evident in the implementation.

Feel free to explore the project and see how these technologies come together to create a seamless and visually appealing user experience.
